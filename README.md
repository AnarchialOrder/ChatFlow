# ChatFlow
Working on a web tool for work.
I do online chat that can be made easier by using common statements that I can copy paste.
The problem is that I keep these statements in a notepad, and if I get more than one or two customers to chat with, it becomes
a bit of an issue to keep track of what the customer's issues are, and where we are in their conversation. 

I am hoping that with this tool, I can keep track of multiple chats at the same time, while including a few features that will
make the entire process easier, while not all out automated.

This will be a test of my basic front end skills, using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. All of this will be plain scripting, no
frameworks under my belt just yet. Thankfully I haven't had to copy anyone's code yet, but if I have to, I will comment in the 
particular file where I found it, as well as note the commits.

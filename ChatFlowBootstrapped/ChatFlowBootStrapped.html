                                        <p>The Touchscreen Controller relies on your home network Wifi to send and receive commands from the App and Subscriber Portal<br>
                                          If this connection is interrupted, your system will still work on a "local" level - meaning that you can arm and disarm from the Touchscreen Controller and Wireless Keypads, but not from the App or Subscriber Portal.<br><br>
              							              I can assure you that your system is still monitoring your devices even when the network issue occurs. The Touchscreen Controller has a backup cellular connection that it uses only to update the Central Monitoring Station in the case of alarm events.<br><br>
                                          To fix this issue, we will need to check your home networking equipment's connections, and reboot them if they are properly hooked up.<br><br>
                                          From what I can see of your equipment set up, your Touchscreen Controller is connected to your All-In-One Xfinity Wireless Gateway.<br><br>
                                          From what I can see of your equipment set up, your Touchscreen Controller is connected to your Netgear Security Router.<br><br>

                                                I will need to ask you to reboot the Touchscreen Controller manually. <br><br>
                                                To reboot it manually you will need a Phillips head (cross) screwdriver and a small paperclip. The screwdriver will be used to take the stand off, while the paper clip will be used to press a button in a small hole.<br><br>
                                                The stand has two small screws on the bottom back of the Touchscreen controller. If there aren't screws there, it will look like there is a hole with gold colored metal inside.<br><br>
                                                Once the screws are out, press down on the top of the stand so that it slides, and then pull it off of the Touchscreen controller.<br><br>
                                                The battery cover of the Touchscreen controller should now be visible. It looks like a big rectangle with stickers on the top, and a rounded right side.<br><br>
                                                Near the top left of the battery cover, is a very small hole. This is where the reset button is housed.<br><br>
                                                I'll need to ask you to be very carefull not to press red the panic button as you do this next step, as it may cause a false alarm.<br><br>
                                                You will need to put one end of the paper clip into the hole, and press it down into the hole for about ten seconds, or until the screen turns on.<br><br>
                                                Please let me know if it does not turn on after 1 minute.<br><br>
                                                Good to hear! As long as you are careful not to press the red panic button, you can re-attach the stand to the Touchscreen Controller.  </p>

                                  								Snap the back plate to the back of the Touchscreen by inserting the top tabs into the slots first, then pressing the bottom into place. Ensure all slack from the AC power cable is pulled through the back plate.<br><br>

                                        <p>If I may, I'll ask you to powercycle the camera. This involves unplugging the camera for about twenty seconds, and then plugging it back in.

                                          I will need to reboot your Modem. This reboot will take about three to five minutes.

                                          Next I will need to reboot your Touchscreen Controller for some diagnostic information. In order to do that, your system should be disarmed. If I may, please let me know when the system is disarmed, so that I can start that reboot.<br><br>

                                        <p>Your Camera uses WiFi to broadcast it's live feed to both the Touchscreen Controller and your App/Subscriber Portal.<br>
                                        Due to this, it will depend on the strength of your home network's WiFi signal.<br>
                                        WiFi strength depends on the distance of the two devices and any interference that may be present.<br>
                                        The distance you should keep your camera,(or Camera Power Brick if you have the xCam), from the Touchscreen Controller and your Modem or Router should be no more than 35 feet.<br>
                                       Interference can be caused by  thick surfaces (e.g., concrete floors and walls) and other household electronics, such as baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, refrigerators and Bluetooth-connected devices. Also, try to avoid crowded areas, such as inside or behind furniture, like an entertainment console.<br>
                                       What I would recommend is that you make sure that the Touchscreen Controller and the Modem or Router for your Internet connection both
                                       have an uninterrupted line of sight to your Camera (or Camera Power Brick, if you have the xCam.)<br>
                                       If there is interference, I will have to recommend that you move the modem and Touchscreen Controller closer to strengthen the WiFi signal for the camera.<br><br>If it helps, here is an article that details how to improve your wifi. The principles outlined there apply to your Secure devices as well:

                                  You can arm your XFINITY Home - Secure system in three modes: Arm Away, Arm Stay, and Arm Night.<br><br>

                                  Arm Away gives you time to leave the house (Exit Delay) and then activates your system, including the Motion Sensors. When you come home, you have time to disarm the system (Entry Delay) so you don't trigger an alarm. If you activate Arm Away and no one leaves the house using a monitored door, the system automatically switches to Arm Stay mode.<br><br>

                                  Arm Stay is for when you are at home and awake. Security features are activated as in Arm Away, but Motion Sensors are not (so you don't trip the alarm while you're in the house).<br><br>

                                  Arm Night is for when you go to sleep. The system is activated as in Arm Away and Arm Stay, but with no Entry Delay when you disarm the system. Motion Sensors can be activated with or without an Exit Delay, depending on your setup. Typically, Motion Sensors are activated immediately in areas where you are not going to be, while Motion Sensors are delayed in places you'll pass through on your way to your bedroom.<br><br>

                                  If an Entry/Exit door is left open at the end of Exit Delay, the Entry Delay immediately starts and, if the system is not disarmed, an alarm will sound.<br><br>

                            <p>Thank you for confirming. There was an update that went out recently to bring the Touchscreen Controller sounds in line with certain regulations and standards. Unfortunately this update did not perform well, and we've had to roll it back. <br><br>In order to return the volume to normal, I will need to ask you to perform a few steps with the Touchscreen Controller. Please let me know when you are ready for these steps.<br><br>
                      				Thanks. Here are the steps to follow:<br>
                      				1) First turn the hardware rocker volume switch on the side of the touchscreen all the way down.<br>
                      				2) Press the “…” button on the top right of the touchscreen.<br>
                      				3) Press “Settings”.<br>
                      				4) Enter Master Keypad Code.<br>
                      				5) Press “Security”.<br>
                      				6) Press “Alarm Test”.<br>
                      				7) Press “Next” on the bottom right of the screen.<br>
                      				8) Press “Arm” on the top right of the screen. Then you will see that status update from “Arm to Arming”.<br>
                      				9) As the touchscreen starts beeping (or reporting Arming), press the hardware rocker volume switch on the side of the touchscreen to the desired level.<br>
                      				Please make sure of the first step, as it is key to this process. You will have about five seconds to do this during the test, so you will need to raise the volume using the rocker button, and do it quickly before the test ends.<br><br>If it helps, here is an article that details how to change the volume on the Touchscreen Controller:<br>https://www.xfinity.com/support/home-security/change-sound-settings-for-touchscreen/<br><br>To recap - Unfortunately your Touchscreen Controller was affected by an update that was applied, and then rolled back. Thankfully you were able to take a few steps with the controller to bring the volume back to normal. At this time there are no further questions.</p>

However, once you disarm the system, the bypass setting is defaulted back to the "on" state. This means that you will need to bypass this sensor every time before you arm the system, or until the issue with that sensor is resolved. </p>
                            <p>Bypass on App: From the Overview screen (the first one that shows when you launch the app), scroll down to the device that you would like to bypass. Press the three dots in the upper right of that device, which will take you to it's settings page. From there you should see an option for device on or off. Toggle the device off, and then go back to the overview screen to arm the system.

                                  <p>Bookmarked video clips are saved when the Camera detects motion (an event). A break in the event timeline could be caused by one of the following:<br>
                                  Power loss<br>
                                  Internet outage<br>

                                  If poor connectivity seems to be the cause, try moving the Camera or router to another location.<br><br>

                                  If none of these seem to be the cause, reboot the Camera.</p>

                                  If it helps, here is a link that will detail how you can manage your rules from the Xfinity Home Mobile App:<br>
                                  https://www.xfinity.com/support/home-security/manage-rules-mobile-app-secure/?currentTopicId=afec3d0e-1af4-4c47-b1d5-7dc41bd25d37&currentCollectionId=afec3d0e-1af4-4c47-b1d5-7dc41bd25d37-3<br><br><br>

                                  The XFINITY Home app for mobile devices shows you all of your rules - both those you add in the app and, if you're an XFINITY Home - Secure customer, those you add in your XFINITY Home Subscriber Portal.<br><br>
                                  Rules that you add in the app can be viewed and managed only in the app. They won't appear in your Subscriber Portal.<br>
                                  For rules added in your Subscriber Portal, you can enable, disable, and delete them in the app, but if you want to change them, you'll need to use the Subscriber Portal.<br>
                                  We're always working on improving rules, so check out both the app and the Subscriber Portal to see the kinds of rules you can add in each. <br><br><br>

                                    The Automation screen lists your existing rules. The top of the screen shows a recommended rule that you might want to add to your system. Swipe left or right to see other recommended rules.<br>
                                    The icon(s) to the left of the rule name tell you whether or not you can change the rule in the XFINITY Home app for mobile devices. A rule with multiple icons was added in the app and can be changed. A rule with only the Automation icon was added in the Subscriber Portal (XFINITY Home - Secure only) and cannot be changed in the app.<br>
                                    The icon(s) to the right of the rule name tell you the conditions that limit when the rule is active: Arm mode, Days, and Times. If there are no icons, the rule is always active. <br><br>

                                    It sounds like these rules are the basic rules that came with the system. Is this correct?<br><br>

                                    In order to change the basic rules, you will need to access the previous version of the subscriber portal<br><br>

                                    To access the previous version of the subscriber portal, you will need to first access the current one. This can be found at: https://home.xfinity.com/<br>
                                    From here, you will need to find the link that says Previous Version of Subscriber Portal. From this version of the subscriber portal, you can access the rules and modify them from there.

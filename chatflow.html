                          <p>The Touchscreen Controller relies on your home network Wifi to send and receive commands from the App and Subscriber Portal<br>
                            If this connection is interrupted, your system will still work on a "local" level - meaning that you can arm and disarm from the Touchscreen Controller and Wireless Keypads, but not from the App or Subscriber Portal.<br>
                            I can assure you that your system is still monitoring your devices even when the network issue occurs. The Touchscreen Controller has a backup cellular connection that it uses only to update the Central Monitoring Station in the case of alarm events.<br>
                            To fix this issue, we will need to check your home networking equipment's connections, and reboot them if they are properly hooked up.<br>
                            From what I can see of your equipment set up, your Touchscreen Controller is connected to your All-In-One Xfinity Wireless Gateway.<br>
                            From what I can see of your equipment set up, your Touchscreen Controller is connected to your Netgear Security Router.</p>

                                  I will need to ask you to reboot the Touchscreen Controller manually. <br>
                                  To reboot it manually you will need a Phillips head (cross) screwdriver and a small paperclip. The screwdriver will be used to take the stand off, while the paper clip will be used to press a button in a small hole.<br>
                                  The stand has two small screws on the bottom back of the Touchscreen controller. If there aren't screws there, it will look like there is a hole with gold colored metal inside.<br>
                                  Once the screws are out, press down on the top of the stand so that it slides, and then pull it off of the Touchscreen controller.<br>
                                  The battery cover of the Touchscreen controller should now be visible. It looks like a big rectangle with stickers on the top, and a rounded right side.<br>
                                  Near the top left of the battery cover, is a very small hole. This is where the reset button is housed.<br>
                                  I'll need to ask you to be very carefull not to press red the panic button as you do this next step, as it may cause a false alarm.<br>
                                  You will need to put one end of the paper clip into the hole, and press it down into the hole for about ten seconds, or until the screen turns on.<br>
                                  Please let me know if it does not turn on after 1 minute.<br>
                                  Good to hear! As long as you are careful not to press the red panic button, you can re-attach the stand to the Touchscreen Controller.  </p>

                            I will need to reboot your Modem. This reboot will take about three to five minutes, and will interrupt your Internet service while it is rebooting. Please let me know when it's okay to start that reboot.<br>

                          <p>Your Camera uses WiFi to broadcast it's live feed to both the Touchscreen Controller and your App/Subscriber Portal.<br>
                          Due to this, it will depend on the strength of your home network's WiFi signal.<br>
                          WiFi strength depends on the distance of the two devices and any interference that may be present.<br>
                          The distance you should keep your camera,(or Camera Power Brick if you have the xCam), from the Touchscreen Controller and your Modem or Router should be no more than 35 feet.<br>
                         Interference can be caused by  thick surfaces (e.g., concrete floors and walls) and other household electronics that may cause interference with the WiFi signal, such as baby monitors, cordless phones, microwave ovens, refrigerators and Bluetooth-connected devices. Also, try to avoid crowded areas, such as inside or behind furniture, like an entertainment console.<br>
                         What I would recommend is that you make sure that the Touchscreen Controller and the Modem or Router for your Internet connection both
                         have an uninterrupted line of sight to your Camera (or Camera Power Brick, if you have the xCam.)<br>
                         If there is interference, I will have to recommend that you move the modem and Touchscreen Controller closer to strengthen the WiFi signal for the camera.

                <p>The bypass setting will allow you to arm your system if the device has encountered an issue that would normally prevent you from arming. However, once you disarm the system, the bypass setting is defaulted back to the "on" state. This means that you will need to bypass this sensor every time before you arm the system, or until the issue with that sensor is resolved. </p>
                <p>Bypass on App: From the Overview screen (the first one that shows when you launch the app), scroll down to the device that you would like to bypass. Press the three dots in the upper right of that device, which will take you to it's settings page. From there you should see an option for device on or off. Toggle the device off, and then go back to the overview screen to arm the system. If it helps, here is a link that details how to access the device settings screen and where to find the on/off toggle: <br>

<!--Where you left off:
- Filling in the information for each menu type in the contentwrap view
- copy text javascript buttons
- reset all button to start over for new chat
- Style based on material stuffs. Gotta look into it.
- Next big project step will be converting this all to a javascript format, where all the values update due to actions,
- so I dont have to mess with all the divs within divs. I hope to keep the html file clean, while keeping all
- of the information locked into variables. This will also give me the ability to eventually make this available to
- other agents, as they can enter in their own information.
